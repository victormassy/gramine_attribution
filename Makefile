# gramine-sgx-sign generates both a .sig file and a .manifest.sgx file. This is somewhat
# hard to express properly in Make. The simple solution would be to use
# "Rules with Grouped Targets" (`&:`), however make on Ubuntu <= 20.04 doesn't support it.
#
# Simply using a normal rule with "two targets" is equivalent to creating separate rules
# for each of the targets, and when using `make -j`, this might cause two instances
# of gramine-sgx-sign to get launched simultaneously, potentially breaking the build.#
# As a workaround, we use a dummy intermediate target, and mark both files as depending on it, to
# get the dependency graph we want. We mark this dummy target as .INTERMEDIATE, which means
# that make will consider the source tree up-to-date even if the sgx_sign file doesn't exist,
# as long as the other dependencies check out. This is in contrast to .PHONY, which would
# be rebuilt on every invocation of make.
